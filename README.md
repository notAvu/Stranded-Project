This is a little game I made as a final project for class using Unity.
My main goal was learning the basics of Unity 2D and game development 

Download [0.1.0 version](https://github.com/notAvu/Stranded-Project/releases/tag/0.1.0)
# Concept

A fast paced, Momentum-based 2D platformer.

# Main mechanics:	
- Rope throwing and swinging 
- A "parry-like" system based on timing to kill enemies
- <s> Health affects movement (Not sure of how just now, but I have a couple different ideas)	</s> [Update: I realised this idea is actually bad, may be interesting but I ain't got enough time to think of a proper way to implement it without level design being bland or extremely hard]
- Natural forces (wind, water...) to mess with 		

If i have enough time i'd like to implement:
- An orb you can parry like an enemy that slows time for a short time
- A final boss 
- A secondary projectile (Either a second rope with different properties or an explosive one to push stuff away)

# Structure
This is suposed to be a testing enviroment just for the mechanics, but these are some of the ideas i had in mind about level design:	

- Since I may be short of time, the game will feature just the right amount of levels to showcase the mechanics, serving as some sort of "invisible tutorial"	
- There'll be a couple of short levels for the player to get used to the main mechanics (Jumping, ropes, etc) and a bigger one with different game mechanics and enemies	
# Controls 
- A or left arrow - left
- D or roght arrow - right 
- Space - jump
- Shift - Parry/Shield
- left click - throw rope
- esc - pause menu
